In this assignments, two methods for dimension reduction (PCA: unsupervised, LDA: supervised) are discussed. In the first exercise, I fitted an PCA on a dataset containing facial expression images. Other concepts such as
displaying eigen values and trace value for separability matrix are also mentioned in the ipynb files.

In the second exercise, I fitted a Gaussian Mixture Model containing of two components to cluster images belonging to two different labels.
