# Machine-Learning-Course-Assignments
Programming and theoretical assignments in Machine Learning Course, University of Tehran, Spring 2023. 

A. 1st Assignment: This assignment is about Naive Bayes Classifier. In the second part of its simulation exercises, a heuristic classifier which obeys the same Bayes rule is designed to classify images belonging to sea and jungle scenes.

B. 2nd Assignment: Implementation of logistic regression classifier to separate points belonging to different labels (2nd exercise). I have also implemented the task of fitting different polinomial curves with regard to bias and variance errors on a set of points (1st exercise).
Estimating the distribution of a feature through using Parzen Window method is also implemented in the third exercise of the simulation part.

C. 3rd Assignment: Different kinds of Neural Networks. In the 1st programming exercise, I fitted a MLP neural network on a dataset containing ECG data. In the 2nd exercise, I implemented a MADALINE network from scratch to separate points belonging to two classes. In the 3rd and 4th exercise, a CNN and a decision tree are used.

D. 4th Assignment: Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM) is used to separate points belonging to two or more classes. The point about SVM is that it tries to classify in a way that the margin between two classes is maximized. In the first exercise, I fitted an SVM on Iris dataset to separate samples belonging to three classes. Different kernels (linear, RBF, polinomial) and different values for c and gamma hyperparameters have been tested. I also employed grid search to find the best values for model tuning.

E. 5th Assignment: Dimension reduction (PCA: unsupervised, LDA: supervised) are discussed. In the first exercise, I fitted an PCA on a dataset containing facial expression images. Other concepts such as displaying eigen values and trace value for separability matrix are also mentioned in the ipynb files. In the second exercise, I fitted a Gaussian Mixture Model containing of two components to cluster images belonging to two different labels.
