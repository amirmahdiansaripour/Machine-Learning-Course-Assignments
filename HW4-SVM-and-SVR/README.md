Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM) is used to separate points belonging to two or more classes. The point about SVM is that it tries to classify in a way that the margin between two classes is maximized.
In the first exercise, I fitted an SVM on Iris dataset to separate samples belonging to three classes. Different kernels (linear, RBF, polinomial) and different values for c and gamma hyperparameters have been tested. I also employed grid search to find the best 
values for model tuning.

In the second part, I fitted a Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict some numerical target values.
