This assignment is about using logistic regression classifier to separate points belonging to different labels (2nd exercise). I have also implemented the task of fitting different polinomial curves with regard to bias and variance errors on a set of points (1st exercise).
Estimating the distribution of a feature through using Parzen Window method is also implemented in the third exercise of the simulation part.
